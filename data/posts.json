    "title": "East of Eden - 1952",
    "content": "East of Eden was written by John Steinbeck in 1952 and attempted to answer one question: Are humans doomed by their nature - or free to choose who they become? \n\nThis novel is much more than that, however. It is a generational story and one that puts life into perspective... without even being the main driving theme. I think that hit home for me the most, at the time of reading this. The novel was a modern retelling of the Genesis story: Cain and Abel. \n\nEast of Eden arrived after moral collapse... post-WWII America was dealing with mass death, genocide, atomic weapons, loss of moral certainty. People were asking If humans are capable of this, what does that say about us? Steinbeck didn't give an excuse, but a responsibility. It rejected deterministic thinking. in the mid 20th century, culture leaned toward psychology explaining everything, trauma as destiny, biology as fate. Steinbeck pushed back: You are not what happened to you. \n\nThe Hebrew word \"Timshel\" means \"Thou mayest\". Meaning you may choose -- Steinbeck claims evil is real, good is possible, but the choice is always present. Even after failure. Am i broken? Am i my past? Steinbeck answers: You may choose.",

    "title": "Frankenstein - 1818",
    "content": "I've always attributed Frankenstein to your typical green monster with prongs coming out of his head. All of that changed once I read this novel, written by Mary Shelley in 1818. This book isn't really even about monsters, but the creation without responsibility - and how that problem grows. \n\nI picked a perfect time to read this novel, considering we are in the midst of an AI revolution. It is interesting to see how such a creation can turn so quickly and you become powerless. I think that says a lot, and our generation (future ones too) need to be careful with Artificial Intelligence and how its designed.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects about reading critically acclaimed historical literature is to understand the times in which the book was written, and why it was impactful. Frankenstein mattered in 1818 as a response to a world drunk of science. Europe was in the middle of the Industrial Revolution, electricity experiments, and Enlightenment faith in reason. Science promised mastery over nature. \n\nShelley asked the question: What happens when humans gain godlike power but keep human flaws? -- It challenged the idea of 'progress'. At the time, progress = good by default. Whereas, Shelley says progress without ethics creates suffering and knowledge alone doesn't equal wisdom... directly challenging Enlightenment optimism. \n\nWhat really hit home was how the monster starts gentle and wants companionship, but only through human rejection becomes violent. The real monster in the novel is Victor Frankenstein... abandoning his creation and refusing to take responsibility. As an effect, numerous innocent people die to protect his reputation. Monsters are made. Not born. \n\nFrankenstein endures because it reveals that the greatest danger isnÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt scientific powerÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂitÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs human ambition without responsibility, empathy, or restraint.",

    "title": "Don Quixote - 1605",
    "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It's comedic timing has outlasted generations, and for good reason. Don Quixote was written by Miguel de Cervantes in Spain, 1605, and is widely considered the first novel ever written. The era of knights vanished in the late 15-16 centuries. During this time, medieval hero was most of, if not, all that was read about. Popular fiction was full of perfect knights, noble quests, and clear moral worlds. Cervantes destroyed that fantasy.... by making a comedic novel over the genre. Don Quixote follows a knight errant, Don Quixote de la Mancha who believes old chivalric books are real, and his squire Sancho Panza as they travel around the countryside in search of great adventures. \n\nIt is very interesting to read such things written centuries ago.... to compare the different verbiage and language. English was much more grandiose, it honestly makes me sad to see where it's become. The long monologues that would stretch numerous pages at a time also was something that required getting used to. The more and more classic literature I read, the more of this I recognize. I'm not sure why writers thought it a 'requirement' to add such lengthy monologues... but definitely something that took some getting used to. \n\nThere are so many different ways you can tie this story to todays day and age. The one that resonates me the most is how the stories Don Quixote read shaped his entire personality - by consuming too much content and confusing stories for reality. That isn't medieval, that is today. Social media and the internet has twisted our brains in different directions with many never really consciously knowing. \n\nIs it better to live in truth or in meaning? Quixote is delusional, but noble. The 'sane' characters are practical, but empty. When Quixote regains sanity, he dies. Cervantes never gives a clear answer --- this ambiguity gave a spark into today's literature.",

He had proven himself capable of commanding loyalty, forging alliances, and succeeding in organized warfare. Unlike traditional Mongol leaders who relied on aristocratic birth, TemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼jin promoted men based on loyalty and merit, creating a power structure that drew ambitious warriors to his side. Jamukha, who came from a more aristocratic background, opposed this radical vision.

According to legend, Jamukha boiled 70 male captives alive in a giant cauldron after the decisive victory. TemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼jin retreated with his core supporters and rebuilt. The loss marked a setback, but hardened TemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼jin, preparing him for the long road ahead. \n\nAlthough TemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼jin was crushed, Jamukha's brutality cost him followers and many warriors defected from Jamukha to TemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼jin. Over the next couple of decades, TemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼jin strengthens ties with allies...many attracted to the merit-based promotions, in contrast with the old aristocratic system. Other reasons people joined TemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼jin: justice & fairness (distributing plunder fairly), and openness to different faiths. This became a major hallmark later as the empire expanded across regions. His growing power lead to years of intermittent wars with rival tribes. These campaigns show his organizational genius - creating military units based on the decimal system (10, 100, 1,000, 10,000). The decimal system wasn't just military - families were grouped into tens, hundreds, etc., to streamline taxation, logistics, and mobilization. Everyone had a clear place in the system. \n\nEventually betrayed by his own men, Jamukha was handed over to TemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼jin in 1201/1202. TemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼jin, recalling their former bond as blood brothers, refused to kill him cruelly. Jamukha asked for a noble death - without bloodshed - so TemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼jin executed him by breaking his back, a more 'honorable' death. \n\nWith TemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼jin's greatest rival gone, he begins to consolidate power....beating out rival tribal powers on the steppe. After a victory over the Tatars in 1202, TemÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼jin executed all males taller than the axle of a cart wheel (to ensure no warrior class survived). After a couple of more victories, by 1204 most of the Mongolian steppe was under his control. And by 1206, he was formally proclaimed Chinggis Khan, meaning 'universal ruler'. The common English \"Genghis\" comes through Persian transmission into Europe, while \"Chinggis\" is closer to the Mongol origin. This was the turning point for the Mongols, once fractured, were now  unified into a single nation under his rule.\n\nGenghis Khan didn't start conquering the known world out of ambition - there were strategic, political, and economic reasons. For starters, the Mongols had a history of raids and retaliations from neighboring tribes and states. Expansion was often preemptive; attacking first before rivals had the chance. The steppe was harsh and sparsely populated. Expanding into more fertile lands, trade routes, and wealthy cities became a priority. Finally, Mongol culture valued fame, honor, and conquest... so yes, ego was involved. \n\nAround 1207-1210, the Mongols set out and targeted northwest China in their first major campaign. Through numerous strategic tactics, the Mongols ultimately came out on top. Infamously, they feigned retreats to lure enemies into ambushes. By the time they knew what was happening, it was too late. The Mongols were quick and mobile, each soldier having on average 5 horses that allowed them to switch often and ensure that no single horse was overworked. It is important to note that cities that resisted were destroyed, populations punished, but those who surrendered were often integrated into the Mongol system. Skilled artisans, engineers, and traders were often spared and absorbed to strengthen the army and economy. \n\nWith Xi Xia (northwest China) under control, Genghis Khan set his sights on the Jin Dynasty (northern China). Starting around 1211, the Mongols launched raids across the border, using hit-an-run cavalry tactics that often confused and overwhelmed the larger Jin armies. By 1215, the Mongols had captured the Jin capital (modern Beijing), demonstrating their methods worked not just against steppe tribes, but also against well-fortified armies. Important to note, they besieged the city through the usage of temporary blockades and encircling cities for weeks, starving out the defenders. \n\nA turning point came in 1218-1221 with the campaign against the Khwarazmian Empire (modern Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan). Initially triggered by the execution of Mongol envoys, Genghis Khan's response was swift and devastating. In 1221, Genghis Khan's favorite grandson was killed in battle. When news reached him, he ordered total annihilation of Nishapur as revenge. Accounts describe the city being burned to the ground, its population slaughtered ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ men, women, children, and even animals. It is said hundreds of thousands were killed (though numbers are exaggerated through Mongolian propaganda). Khwarazm's destruction demonstrated a new scale of Mongol warfare; it was no longer raids or steppe conflicts, but full-scale empire-building, with systematic conquest, integration of conquered peoples, and use of terror as a tool to prevent resistance. \n\nOf interest to note, cities that had already been conquered by the Mongols - if they had accepted Genghis Khan as their ruler - would be left alone. Well, few cities often waited till the Mongols left to then denounce their new ruler. Once word got back to Genghis Khan, he would immediately send small armies to decimate the city. A message to any other conquered city that has thoughts of rebellion. \n\nThe Mongol conquests were not only brilliantly organized ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ they were brutal. When cities resisted, Mongol policy was simple: annihilate or subjugate. Women and children were often captured, absorbed into households or used as forced labor ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ and sexual violence was a common element of that captivity.

Most notably, governors and trusted generals were installed to oversee regions, while trade routes and cities were secured, including the Silk Road. Furthermore, the Mongols continued to invade and occupy more land. His military approach remained the same: combine speed, discipline, intelligence, and terror. Cities that resisted were destroyed, those that surrendered were integrated. Important to note, the Mongols were very adaptable. They would use the terrain to their advantage and adapt other armies weapons/technologies for their own (most notably: Chinese gunpowder). \n\nGenghis Khan died shortly after the Western Xia campaign in 1227, though the exact cause of death is uncertain. His death was kept secret initially to prevent uprisings in newly conquered lands. Still to this day, no one knows where Genghis Khan is buried. Legend has it that a special funeral escort carried his body back into Mongolia and murdered anyone who crossed their path. After the tomb was dug, the builders were killed to remove all witnesses; then the soldiers who killed the builders were killed themselves, and so on - a chain of executions meant to make the grave's location vanish.\n\nThroughout his life, Genghis Khan returned to a mountain in northeastern Mongolia called Burkhan Khaldun, located in the Khentii Mountains. He hid from enemies in his youth when his clan abandoned him (around 1180). He prayed for protection and victory, promising he would always honor the mountain if he survived. After every major conquest, he would return to give thanks, offering prayers and possibly sacrifices. Burkhan Khaldun became his spiritual center, a symbol of divine favor. He decreed that it should be a sacred site, and anyone approaching it without permission should be executed. Today, Burkhan Khaldun is considered almost certainly his burial area (though the tomb has never been found).\n\nGenghis Khan was succeeded by his third son, Odegei. Not the strongest warrior, but a steady administrator and delegator. He completed Genghis's vision of conquest and consolidation, destroying the Jin Dynasty - fully conquering northern China, and oversaw the western campaigns into Russia and Europe (1236-1241).... invading Russia, Poland, Austria, Georgia, Hungary, Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire), and more. During this period, the Mongols couldn't be beaten. They were at the height of their powers, and many nations feared them. \n\nIn 1241, Odegei died suddenly from alcoholism - thus beginning the descent of power for the Mongolians. Mongol custom required all princes and major commanders to return to Mongolia to elect the next Great Khan. If it wasn't for Odegei's death, the Mongols were preparing to invade Austria, Germany, and Italy next - and there's strong evidence they could have succeeded. The withdrawal saved Europe, but it also fractured momentum across the entire Mongolian empire. \n\nWhen Ogedei died, there was no one powerful enough to hold the Empire together -- and with the empire now spanning from China to Eastern Europe, it was too large to manage without a central, respected authority. For the next 100 years, nations continued to swear allegiance to the \"Great Khan\", but this was merely symbolic. In 1368 the Mongols were driven out of China, and by 1480 the Mongols lost all major influence in Central Asia and Russia. By 1500, the empire was long gone, and what remained was essentially modern-day Mongolia.\n\nGenetic studies show a dramatic male-line legacy across Asia: a 2003 Y-chromosome study found a star-shaped cluster present in about 8% of men across a large region (an estimated ~16 million men at the time), and linked it plausibly to Genghis KhanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs male line. Modern research, however, stresses uncertainty ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ the cluster could reflect the reproductive success of multiple elite males or groups, not only Genghis himself. Bottom line: the Mongol conquests left a profound genetic and human trace.",

But beneath that success was growing frustration. The colonies were technically British territory, ruled from across the Atlantic by a king and parliament who rarely set foot on American soil.

From 1919-1933, there was a mass morphine addiction among WWI veterans, widespread cocaine and heroin use, booming nightlife, open homosexuality, and pornography and prostitution legal in many districts. To conservative Germans, it looked like moral collapse, degeneracy, and chaos. This became one of the most powerful propaganda images the Nazis used. \"The War on Drugs\". As we delve further in to this historical account, the irony of this becomes apparent. \n\nDrugs became heavily utilized in Germany during WWII (1939-1945). Whether it was civilian life, military usage, or Hitler himself.... drugs played a crucial role in the Third Reich. Beginning in 1937, when Pervitin (methamphetamine hydrochloride) was first synthesized .. it was an instant hit. Pills were sold over the counter and became a staple in Germany's everyday culture. The drug was a powerful stimulant that boosts dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, increasing alertness, energy, and confidence while suppressing hunger and fatigue. By 1938, Pervitin was everywhere - university students, doctors, truck drivers, and housewives used it to push through exhaustion. \n\nWhen Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, German military doctors were looking for a drug to keep soldiers awake and alert during long campaigns.

Morrel was a wealthy Berlin doctor for the elite, known for his \"vitamin therapies\" and hormone injections. He wasn't respected in the medical community - but was skilled at making powerful people feel better quickly. In 1936, Hitler was suffering from chronic stomach cramps, bloating, and eczema - likely due to stress, his vegetarian diet, and poor sleep.  Theodor Morrel was contacted, soon arriving with injections of vitamins and glucose -- the relief was almost immediate. Hitler was impressed, then appointing Morrel as his personal physician. From that point onward, no one was allowed to treat Hitler medically without Morell's approval. It is important to note, that prior to meeting Morrel, Hitler remained extremely health-consciousÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¦ not drinking, smoking, and avoiding meat. His lifestyle was rigid, controlled, and disciplined. \n\nBy 1938 Hitler was taking multiple daily shots of mixtures that included testosterone and  vitamin cocktail with glucose (among other things). These were stimulant-based hormone boosters that made him feel instantly energized - a feeling that fed his confidence and self-belief.\n\nThe war began in 1939 and Hitler's schedule became nonstop. Many sleepless nights and an increase in stress follows. Morrel responds by increasing dosage and frequency - now daily injections. Leading to Hitler's tolerance to rise, what used to \"energize\" now just \"keeps him normal.\"\n\nBy 1940, Morrel's influence had grown far beyond that of a personal physician. He became indispensable, and Hitler's closest friend. No medical decision was made without him. Externally, Morrel was acquiring companies that produced the compounds he was injecting into Hitler. He went from just Hitler's doctor to a mini pharmaceutical empire inside the Third Reich. This meant no other doctor could replicate his treatments, or replace him. Morrel became the supplier. \n\nFrom June 1941 - November 1944, Adolf Hitler spent over 800 days at \"Wolf's Lair\". What began as a operations headquarters, quickly became a sealed world... leaving Hitler out of touch with reality. With this, drugs became the rhythm of the day. \n\nHitler's health seriously declines by mid-1943. He develops severe stomach and intestinal pain, nausea, and fatigue. This is when Eukodal (oxycodone) first appears in MorellÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs treatment notes. Eukodal is chemically similar to heroin - both begin semi-synthetic opiates. Eukodal was stronger than morphine and delivered a warm, confident, euphoric clarity. Hitler liked how it made him feel. He begins requesting injections when exhausted, in pain, or emotionally unstable. By late 1943-early 1944, Eukodal becomes part of Hitler's rotating medication cycle, though still not daily. \n\nIn the summer of 1944, a bomb explodes within the Wolf's Lair meeting room.

In comes Dr. Giesing (ENT). Giesing treats Hitler's damaged sinuses using Cocaine in nasal applications. Cocaine was a medical anesthetic at the time and Giesing's treatments were initially standard - until, Hitler begins asking for more and moreÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¦ eventually showing dependency behaviors.  \n\nMorell hated Giesing and fought to regain exclusive control over Hitler. Thus beginning a war between doctors. Many tried coming at Morell, claiming he was trying to poison and control Hitler. It wasn't until lab results came back from substances Morell was giving Hitler, that Morell was \"cleared\". Lab results came back standard. Hitler continued to trust Morell, and soon Giesing was driven out of the picture, but Hitler was now physically dependent on both Eukodal and Cocaine. \n\nSpeedball is the term used to reflect the usages of both, Eukodal and Cocaine, at the same time. Hitler became prone to this sort of usages in late 1944-1945. Morell documented Eukodal \"frequent injections\", sometimes 2-3 times a day, and cocaine nasal drops when supply was available... often but irregular. Physically, Hitler's arm took 50 too many injections and even Morell began to worry about the Fuhrer. This was not to inflict with Morells reports however, as he is cited during these times claiming the Fuhrer is in 'excellent health'. When in reality, Hitler was filled up with such drugs that provided him the temporary burst. Hitler was no longer leading the war - he was enduring it, chemically sustained, detached, and increasingly afraid of what would happen if the injections ever stopped.   Germany was now following a leader who was neither rational nor sober. \n\nJust hours after surviving the assassination attempt, Hitler insisted on keeping the scheduled diplomatic meeting with Benito Mussolini. With Hitler doped up on drugs, Mussolini did not get a conversation. He received a performance - intense, feverish, and unstable... as Hitler spoke for 3 hours straight. After the meeting, Mussolini is quoted saying: \"He is not the same man. Something has broken inside him.\" This moment became a turning point in perception ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ among allies, generals, and foreign observers ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ that Hitler was now governing from a place of delusion sustained by drugs and isolation, not from strategy or clarity.\n\nBy 1945, the war was coming to a conclusion with Germany cornered. Berlin was burning, and factories that produced the drugs were either seized or destroyed. Hitler began going through withdrawal symptoms: tremors, pale skin, paranoia, emotional collapse, etc. Eyewitnesses describe the Fuhrer holding meetings seated, restarting thoughts mid-sentence, and would stare blankly before answering questions. One general said: \"It was like speaking to a ghost who refused to understand he was already dead.\"\n\nI want to pause here and speak about the Germans forces during this time. By late 1944 and into 1945, the majority of German trained soldiers were dead, the war was collapsing, and hope began to shrivel. New recruits were teenagers, old men, or wounded returnees. Germany 'needed' a chemical shortcut to endurance, thus came the wonder drug - 5mg of Eukodal, 5mg of Cocaine, and 5mg of Pervitin. This new drug coined \"D-IX\" was used on the U-boat crews in 1945 to ensure the personnel were alert and hyper-focused. However, paranoia, erratic/fatal decisions, and violent outbursts ensued. The war ended before D-IX entered mass production.

As the Soviets began to close in on Berlin, Hitler's last decisions became emotional reflexes, fueled by withdrawal, denial, and fatalism. In March 1945, Hitler ordered the systematic destruction of German infrastructure so the Allied \"would find nothing but scorched earth.\" And in April 1945, Hitler dismisses Morell, due to distrust and fear. Soon after, Hitler marries Eva Braun - not out of love - but because death was nearing and he needed the gesture of loyalty to restore a sense of control. \n\nOn April 30, 1945, with Soviet artillery shaking the earth above, Hitler and Eva retreated to his private room. She took cyanide. Hitler shot himself. The man whose regime had been fueled by stimulants, hormones, opiates, and cocaine died in a state of physical collapse and psychological detachment, his final thoughts wrapped in withdrawal, delusion, and paranoia.\n\nGermany surrendered days later.\n\nSoon after, the United States arrested Morell and began interrogation measures. Though, never amounting to much. Morell denied giving Hitler narcotics.... even though his notebooks full of dosage schedules were seized. Rather than gaining impactful information from Morell, all they got was a depressed, defeated, and sickly man. Morell was released in '46 and died two years later. \n\nI found this very interesting - as school doesn't teach you this side of the war. During the genocide of millions of Jews --- Germany's leader was in isolation experiencing drug-induced psychosis.... But why? Was it guilt? Fear? Self-Doubt?",

Finally, I'll outline the roadmap for hardware deployment and machine learning integration to create a truly intelligent \"desk companion\" capable of learning user preferences, voice patterns, and behavioral context.\n\n\nPart 1: System Architecture\nSection 1.1: Core Services Overview\nThe system is built on five core services that work together: \n\nAudioService handles all voice input/output operations. It uses PyAudio for capturing 16kHz mono audio streams at 1024-byte chunks, records audio segments to WAV files, and interfaces with OpenAI's Whisper model for speech-to-text transcription. The service implements automatic retry logic for transcription failures and saves all audio recordings to timestamped files for future voice training.\n\nDatabaseService manages PostgreSQL connections and all data persistence. It maintains two primary tables: users (storing user_id, bcrypt password hashes, timestamps, failed login attempts, and JSONB metadata for future ML features) and conversations (storing full conversation history with UUIDs, user associations, timestamps, audio file paths, and both user input and AI responses). \n\nAuthService provides secure user authentication. It implements bcrypt password hashing with automatic salt generation, normalizes passwords (lowercase + strip whitespace) for consistent voice-to-text variations, and supports both registration and login flows. The service tracks failed login attempts and maintains last_seen timestamps for user activity monitoring.\n\nLLMService interfaces with Ollama for local LLM inference. Currently configured with llama3.1:8b, it builds complete conversation context from database history, formats messages for the chat API, and implements a system prompt that establishes the AI's personality as an intelligent desk assistant. Response generation typically takes 0.18-0.58 seconds depending on context length.\n\nTTSService converts AI responses to natural speech using pyttsx3. The service configures speech rate at 165 WPM and volume at 0.9, supports multiple voice profiles, and provides real-time audio feedback during user interactions.\n\nSection 1.2: Authentication Flow\nThe authentication system uses voice-based user ID input combined with spoken passwords. When a user first interacts with the system, they speak a 4-digit user ID which is transcribed and parsed through a parser that handles multiple

etc.) and extracts valid 4-digit integers within the 1000-9999 range. This handles the inherent ambiguity of voice input while maintaining security.\nIf the user ID exists, the system prompts for password verification with unlimited attempts. New users create an account by speaking a password phrase which is normalized and hashed with bcrypt before storage. This approach balances security (bcrypt + salting) with usability (voice-based interaction).\n\nSection 1.3: Conversation Loop Architecture\nOnce authenticated, users enter a continuous conversation loop. The system:\n\t1. Captures voice input \n\t2. Transcribes speech using Whisper \n\t3. Builds conversation context by loading ALL past conversations from PostgreSQL and formatting them as message history for the LLM\n\t4. Generates AI response through Ollama with full context awareness\n\t5. Speaks the response via TTS\n\t6. Persists the exchange to the database with UUID, timestamps, and audio file paths\nExit commands (\"goodbye\", \"exit\", \"quit\", \"logout\", \"bye\") are detected through keyword matching and gracefully terminate the session.\n\n\nPart 2: Technical Challenges & Solutions\nChallenge 2.1: Database Schema Evolution\nProblem: My initial schema had a generic users table with just a name field, which didn't support the authentication system I was building. I needed to migrate to a proper authentication schema while preserving the ability to add ML features later.\nSolution: I created a migration script that drops old tables and rebuilds from a new schema.sql. The new schema uses user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY for 4-digit voice IDs, stores bcrypt password_hash, tracks security metrics (failed_attempts, last_seen), and includes BYTEA fields for future voice/face embeddings and JSONB metadata for flexible ML feature storage. This schema supports the current authentication flow while being extensible for ML enhancements.\n\nChallenge 2.2: Voice Input Parsing Reliability\nProblem: Whisper transcription of spoken numbers is inconsistent. A user saying \"1234\" might get transcribed as \"one two three four\", \"twelve thirty-four\", \"1 2 3 4\", or various other formats. This made authentication unreliable.\nSolution: I think it is simply easier to show you. I created a parser with multiple fallback strategies:\n\n~~~~~CODE SNIIPET~~~~~\ndef parse_user_id(transcription: str) -> Optional[int]:\n    # Try direct int conversion first\n    try:\n        user_id = int(text)\n        if 1000 <= user_id <= 9999:\n            return user_id\n    except ValueError:\n        pass\n    \n    # Map words to digits (handles homophones)\n    word_to_digit = {\n        'zero': '0', 'oh': '0',\n        'one': '1', 'won': '1',\n        'two': '2', 'to': '2', 'too': '2',\n        # ... full mapping\n    }\n    \n    # Replace words with digits\n    for word, digit in word_to_digit.items():\n        text = text.replace(word, digit)\n    \n    # Extract digits and validate range\n    digits_only = ''.join(c for c in text if c.isdigit())\n~~~~~CODE SNIIPET~~~~~\n\nChallenge 2.3: LLM Context Management\nProblem: Initially, I misunderstood how LLMs maintain context. I thought Ollama would \"remember\" conversations automatically. When the AI couldn't recall past interactions, I realized LLMs are statelessÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthey need explicit context on every request.\nSolution: I implemented build_conversation_history() which loads the user's complete conversation history from PostgreSQL and formats it as a message array for Ollama's chat API.

    "content": "I built a chess engine in C++ that plays at approximately 1500 ELO using both classical search algorithms and modern machine learning. The engine has two evaluation modes: a classical engine using hand-crafted evaluation with NegaMax search, Alpha-Beta pruning, and quiescence search, and a neural network trained on over 1 million (change!!) chess positions from Lichess games. \n\nThis post is structured in two parts. First, I'll walk through the classical engine architecture - the core algorithms, move ordering optimizations, and debugging challenges that taught me as much about software engineering as they did about chess. Then, I'll cover the machine learning pipeline: data collection and preprocessing, neural network architecture, training on 1M positions(change!!!), and the production integration using PyTorch and ONNX Runtime to deploy the model in C++.\n\nYou can try both engines at [ENTER URL] - the interface lets you toggle between classical and neural network evaluation modes to compare their playing styles.\n\n\nPart 1: Core Search Architecture \n\nSection 1.1:  NegaMax with Alpha-Beta Pruning - The Core Algorithm\nThe foundation of the classical engine is NegaMax. Instead of alternating between maximizing and minimizing perspectives, NegaMax always maximizes from the current player's viewpoint by negating the opponent's score. Next, we have Alpha-beta pruning which represents the best score we've guaranteed so far (lower bound), while beta is the opponent's best alternative (upper bound). If we find a move scoring >= beta, the opponent will avoid this position, so we can stop searching this branch entirely. This cuts the search tree by 50-75%, letting the engine search 2-3 plies deeper.\n\nSection 1.2:  Quiescence Search - Avoiding Tactical Blindness\nMoving further, we implemented quiescence search in order to avoid the horizon effect. The horizon effect is when the engine doesn't search far enough depth wise during tactical sequences. Why? Because it sees a good move and plays it - without seeing what comes soon after that move. This can lead to bad play by the engine. To negate this I implemented quiescence search that extends beyond the nominal depth, examining only tactical moves until the position becomes quiet. With this, I integrated delta pruning. This ensures that captures are skipped that can't improve the position. For example, If the current position evaluates to -200, and we can capture a pawn worth +100, the best we could hope for is -100. But if alpha is already +50 (we've found a line guaranteeing us +50), this capture is futile - it can't possibly beat what we already have. So we skip it.\n\nSection 1.3:  Transposition Tables - Eliminating Redundant Work \nAnother piece to the puzzle was implementing a transposition table. Chess positions can transpose - reach the same position through different move orders. A transposition table is a massive hash table (1M+ entries) that caches position evaluations to avoid redundant work. The table uses Zobrist hashing - a technique where each piece on each square has a random 64-bit number. The position's hash is the XOR of all these numbers, making hash updates O(1) during move make/unmake.\n\n\nPart 2:  Move Ordering \n\nAlpha-beta pruning's effectiveness depends entirely on examining good moves first. With optimal move ordering, the first move causes a beta cutoff 50-60% of the time. With poor ordering, this drops to 10-20%, forcing the engine to search 3-5x more positions. In order to improve upon this I implemented a multi-tier move ordering system: \n\t1.

Squaring the depth gives more weight to stronger moves that work deeper in the tree.\n\nPart 3:  Position Evaluation \n\nOnce the search reaches a leaf node, the evaluation function determines \"how good is this position?\" This is where we teach the engine what makes a chess position strong or weak. For example, a knight on the rim is worth maybe 280, whereas a centralized knight is worth 360.\n\nPawn Structure \n\t- Doubled pawns:  -10 penalty\n\t- Isolated pawns:  -15 penalty \n\t- Passed pawns:  +20-50 depending on how advanced \n\nKing Safety \n\t- Castled: +20 bonus\n\t- Pawn shield: +5 per pawn in front of king\n\t- Becomes less important in the endgame when king should activate \n\nCenter Control provides a bonus for pieces controlling central squares -- encouraging piece activity. \n\nMobility counts pseudo-legal moves for each piece. More moves = more options = better position. This is expensive to compute, so I made it optional with a compile-time flag.\n\n\nPart 4:  Performance Metrics \n\nPart 4.1:  Raw Search Performance\nThe engine achieves approximately 12,000-15,000 nodes per second on consumer hardware after optimizations. For context, modern engines at this strength level typically reach 50,000-500,000 nodes/second, so there's significant room for improvement. However, raw speed isn't everything - what matters more is how efficiently those nodes are being searched.\n\t\nPart 4.2:  Move Ordering Effectiveness\nThe critical metric for search efficiency is the first-move cutoff rate - how often does the first move examined at a node cause a beta cutoff, allowing us to skip searching all remaining moves?\n\nHere's how my engine performs across different position types:\n\nPosition Type:       First-Move Cutoff     Nodes/Second  \nOpening                             60.7%                     15,000\nEarly middlegame             42%                       13,500\nTactical complexity           13.7%                    6,384\nQuiet endgame                  58%                       14,800\n\nThat third row was the smoking gun. In tactically sharp positions with multiple captures available, move ordering completely broke down.\n\nPart 4.3:  The Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE) Impact\nThe problem was clear: the engine was trying captures in the wrong order. Before SEE, all captures were scored equally high (1,000,000+ points) using simple MVV-LVA (Most Valuable Victim - Least Valuable Attacker).
